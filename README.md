# Helloworld_cpp

In this project I get the basics set up for c++

## Setting up

* Started off `hello` branch
* added cmake `sudo apt-get install cmake`

## Resources

* [the quickstart](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cmake-quickstart)
* [getting started with cmake](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/CMake-linux)


## Notes & the plan

1. I have a basic understanding of what `CMake` is and does
1. This will probably help in managing a code base
1. Found some sort of [modern template](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/chapters/basics/structure.html) for project structure
    1. Moving the code to `src` folder was easy, just updated `CMakeLists.txt` to get the build working again
1. Probably should revisit this structure & setup once I get a better understanding of functions and header files.
1. Just noticed the buttons in vscode for build, debug and launch at bottom left, next to git branch
