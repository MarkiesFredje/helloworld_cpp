In this project I get the basics set up for c++

## Setting up

* added `out` to `.gitignore`
* Experimenting with some data types

## Resources

* Cherno's [variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB9RI8_wExo&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb&index=8&pp=iAQB)


## Notes & the plan

1. Learned a bit about basic variable types
1. Should pick up where I left off
