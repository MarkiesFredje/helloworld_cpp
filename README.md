# Helloworld_cpp

In this project I get the basics set up for c++

## Setting up

* Started off `conditions` branch

## Resources

* Cherno's [references](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzoFn3dfsPA&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb&index=17)

## Notes & the plan

1. `references` are just syntax suger for `pointers`
1. you dont need to `*ptr = value` for a reference, making it easier to read etc
1. once a `reference` is set, its set.  You cant change it to another variable!
